                I am passionate about entrepreneurship, technology, and working on
                old cars.  I try to give back to the development community
                by teaching students software development. If that's not enough,
                I am also a PhD Candidate.

                <p>Throughout my career I've always gravitated to helping lead teams achieve great things.</p>
                <p>In the Navy I started at the very lowest enlisted rank and worked my way up to an officer. I found myself responsible for helping to build flight tracking software responsible for many thousands of people.</p>
                <p>More recently, I have started several software companies, including Summertime Software, Inc and StarterData, Inc. Both companies were focused on Real Estate-related software. I love finding new ways to help solve complex tasks in Real Estate.</p>
                <p>I have also been the Chief Technology Officer and Product Manager for Ticor Title and then ServiceLink. During that time I helped to build a large-scale deployment of new in-house systems and to implement many cost-saving measures.</p>

                <p>My strongest technology skill is my desire to learn.  I want to spend every moment learning and inventing the technology of our time.
                </p>
                <p>In college I found out how much I didn't already know.  Computing is an enormous field and one could spend a lifetime trying to explore it all.  I went to USC (Undergrad), Texas A&M (Masters) and am currently a Doctorial student at University of Missouri, St Louis.</p>
                <p>My technical expertise involves:
                  <ul>
                  <li>AI/Machine Learning - Tensorflow, Keras, and JAX. Building, training and evaluation</li>
                  <li>SQL - Database design, optimization, and query performance tuning</li>
                  <li>C# & .NET - Enterprise-level applications, APIs, and back-end development</li>
                    <li>Node.js - Scalable server-side solutions and microservices</li>
                      <li>C++ - High-performance computing and system-level programming</li>
                        <li>JavaScript - Interactive web applications and full-stack development</li>

                <p>With so much time being spent working in the digital world, I found I needed more "tangible experiences."  On my off time I enjoy working on old cars, golfing and running.</p>
                <p>I've had several old cars, but am currently working on just one:</p>

                <h5>1932 Ford Pickup</h5>
                <p>This may seem like a funny focus, but this is a very special truck.  It was built during the final, toughest years of the depression.  Many didn't have the money to buy a new pickup, so sales were down compared to prior years.  Fast forward 100 years and this helps make the 1932 Ford a very sought-after year.</p>

          <h5>Turtles Are Amazing Creatures</h5>
          <p>One of my favorite things to do is swim in Hawaii. Inevitably, a turtle will pop up, swimming right next to me. I am always amazed by these graceful swimmers. They are both modern and prehistoric at the same time.</p>
          <p>When deciding what to feature on this page, a silent, swimming turtle just seemed appropriate. I hope you enjoy its moves.</p>

          <p>One of my coworkers, Karen Eckert, is a world-renowned turtle expert. She has been saving turtles throughout the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean for many years. I'll try to post a link to her research.</p>

          <h5>Technical Notes</h5>
          <p>Because some have asked... This is a Three.js real-time rendered scene. No movie here—your browser is rendering this in real time. The scene has a near and far clipping plane in which the turtle swims. As different objects move in and out of the planes, they are added and removed dynamically.</p>
          <p>The turtle moves in as realistic a simulation of swimming as I could build. As it randomly chooses a new direction, the camera tries to keep up, much like a swimmer trying to keep their eye on a passing turtle.</p>
          <p>Does it make you want to go Maui?</p>
